What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

answer: When I moved to Australia, I did not know that I would become a developer, I studied software developer and my first venture, I started volunteering without any understanding, experience or idea of how this works. In 3 months, I was part of the team as a junior web developer for having learned quickly the technologies used in the project and applied successfully. I always strive to learn as much as I can from my experiences.
This was a great satisfaction for me, facing different barriers
